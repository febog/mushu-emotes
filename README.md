# Mushu's emotes üêâ

Welcome!

This is a small website for keeping track of Mushu's Twitch channel FFZ, BTTV and 7TV emotes.

https://febog.github.io/mushu-emotes/

## Description

1. Retrieves the enabled channel emotes from BTTV, FFZ and 7TV.
2. Builds a JSON array with all the emotes sorted by name.
3. This JSON is saved to a file that is used by GitHub pages to display all the emotes in a table.

Note that the JSON containing the emotes is committed to this repo, which provides version control of the emote array itself.
