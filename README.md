# Mushu's emotes üêâ

Welcome!

This is a small website for keeping track of Mushu's Twitch channel FFZ and BTTV emotes.

https://febog.github.io/mushu-emotes/

## Description

Retrieves the enabled channel emotes from BTTV and FFZ. Builds a JSON array with all the emotes sorted by name. This JSON is saved to a file that is used by GitHub pages to display all the emotes in a table.

At the same time, this JSON containing the emotes is committed to this repo, which provides version control of the emotes.
